Video Battle
=======

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to tone the skills I had learned with the SERN stack as well as test how well I could pick up new technologies on the fly. 

## About the Site

The inspiration for video battle comes from the subreddit r/youtubehaiku where users can post short funny videos that can be upvoted or downvoted. I used to frequent the subreddit and desired to recreate the idea into its own dedicated website. It was used as a personal project for my time at DevMountain, and was created in 12 days.

## Technologies Used
I started out with React.js, Node.js, Express, Redux, and SQL. I set up my initial SQL database but then decided to test my abilities by picking a new database technology - something I hadn't used before. I ended up picking Firebase for my database, since there is a lot in the Firebase Suite that is useful in Web Development. I figured it could be a good stepping stone into some of the other features.

Along with this I integrated Material-UI, SASS, Chart.js, and some GSAP, all of which I had never used before. It was a challenging experience definitely, but it was one I learned a lot from.
